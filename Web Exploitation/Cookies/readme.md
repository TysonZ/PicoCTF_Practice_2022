Description: Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:6418/

### Resolution
For this task I didn't use the command line.
I opened the webpage in Safari, and observed the following web cookie:

```
name	-1	mercury.picoctf.net	/	Session	6 B			
```
I then entered the placeholder text 'snickerdoodle' in to the search bar and observed the value change to 0.
From there I attempted to modify the value of name to 1 and refreshed the page.
I then received a new result that I did not have prior knowledge of, "I love chocolate chip cookies!".  
I continued to increment the value until I reached #18, which returned the flag.
